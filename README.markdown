# About Ext.ux.grid.ButtonColumn

## Info

This is a User Extension for ExtJS 3, you can download ExtJS at [sencha.com](www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) 
Ext.ux.grid.ButtonColumn is a user extension that implements Ext.Button components placed in a grid row and supplements
the Ext.grid.ActionColumn. I've had several client cases that required an actual button in a grid cell instead of a clickable
image or icon. From a usability standpoint this is a little more intuitive but be aware that this might have a serious impact
on your performance.

## Usage

For now you can refer to the examples included in this repo.

## Running the examples

To run the included examples just follow these simple steps

* Download a recent version of the ExtJS 3 branch from [sencha.com](www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and extract it somewhere on your computer. 
* Copy the *ButtonColumn.js* and *ButtonColumn.css* into the *examples/ux/* folder of the ExtJS 3 folder you just extracted
* Copy the whole *examples/buttoncolumn* folder from this repo into the *examples* folder. 
* Then just open the *buttoncolumn.html* file in your browser.
